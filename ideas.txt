gmaps integration? for an accurate time/travel between places
make the final itinerary page have a maps view of the suggested places

some loading banner or distraction (clash royale style) whilst the program is thinking of how to build the itinerary

post/share to social media 

consider how many parents there are + what they want to do

if youre suggesting a show or a river cruise, ensure that there is actually a show and river cruise at that time

have children inside of a toggle
same for activities on the generated itinerary

ability to remember the user or add in a profile (so it learns I have a 3 year old child)

improved/more accurate pricing eg. for the tube

503 error fixing during regeneration - same as before with the retrying interval


Error 429 if reached my daily quota:

                There was an error swapping the activity. Please try again.
