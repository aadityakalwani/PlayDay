when dragging and dropping the trips/ itinerary items, make the time also adjust

make the final itinerary page look better (wider? with a maps view of the suggested places)

below the time, a image of the place and also a map that when clicked upon takes you to google maps 

improved prompt for dietary requirements (testing)

gmaps integration? for an accurate time/travel between places

post/share to social media 

Chatbot -> "what can this app do" (Kulbir)

sprinkle some icons / images / emojis 
- split interests into themes?
