gmaps integration? for an accurate time/travel between places
make the final itinerary page have a maps view of the suggested places

some loading banner or distraction whilst the program is thinking of how to build the itinerary

post/share to social media 

sprinkle some icons / images / emojis 
- split interests into themes?

consider how many parents there are + what they want to do

journey summary at the top
short summary view of activities one after eachother → very simple summary

if youre suggesting a show or a river cruise, ensure that there is actually a show and river cruise at that time

suggested waiting period for the program to load (eg. "gemini is cooking estimated time 10 seconds in the meantime yada yada just like clash royale loading screen)

have children inside of a toggle
same for activities on the generated itinerary

ability to remember the user or add in a profile (so it learns I have a 3 year old child)

improved/more accurate pricing eg. for the tube

list of where the walking time is actually coming from in the 'total walking time' eg:
1 hour total walking time:
    - 15 minutes london eye to hyde park
    ...

if something in the form was incorrect (eg. no date seleted) then show an error message to the suer above the ‘build my trip button’ so they don’t have to scroll

what if I don’t like any of the activities? add in maybe two options and you clicke ith one you prefer, or that it will ’try again’ on a certain option and take a new place (another request to gemini)
