when dragging and dropping the trips/ itinerary items, make the time also adjust

make the final itinerary page have a maps view of the suggested places

below the time, a image of the place and also a map that when clicked upon takes you to google maps 

gmaps integration? for an accurate time/travel between places

some loading banner or distraction whilst the program is thinking of how to build the itinerary

post/share to social media 

Chatbot -> "what can this app do" (Kulbir)

sprinkle some icons / images / emojis 
- split interests into themes?
