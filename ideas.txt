gmaps integration? for an accurate time/travel between places
make the final itinerary page have a maps view of the suggested places

some loading banner or distraction (clash royale style) whilst the program is thinking of how to build the itinerary

post/share to social media 

consider how many parents there are + what they want to do

if youre suggesting a show or a river cruise, ensure that there is actually a show and river cruise at that time

have children inside of a toggle
same for activities on the generated itinerary

ability to remember the user or add in a profile (so it learns I have a 3 year old child)

improved/more accurate pricing eg. for the tube

what if I don’t like one of the activities?
     a button for each activity that will ’try again’ on a certain option and take a new place (another request to gemini?)
        - if the user wants to regenerate, allow them an option
